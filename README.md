# Game-Saves
Here are my own personal retro video game saves. I put a lot of time into many of these just so your RetroPie gaming experience is maximized.

Please do not worry about the RPG's because I make sure that each RPG game save I have, and will, upload, will be the best and making sure that everyone is at level 99.


RPG Notice #1: Super Mario RPG just needs 2 things - 100 jumps & Koopa Climb (or Scale the Cliff) [at Land's End]


RPG Notice #2: Super Mario RPG has each of the characters put the majority of the stats is what they go towards. Mario and Geno have had HP chosen 3 times, but was mainly for the Physical/Magic standings.

  Mario: Physical/Magic

  Peach: HP/Magic

  Bowser: Physical

  Mallow: HP/Magic/Physical

  Geno: Physical/Magic
